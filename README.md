# Genshin-Impact-Wish-Simulator
I just recreated a basic version of Genshin's Standard Wish system in Python. Feel free to use it

Im fairly new to Python but made this and wanted to share. Btw as you can see theres an option for entering 'q' in the input to quit the program but it won't always work. I dont know why but just keep tryng and it should work eventually
